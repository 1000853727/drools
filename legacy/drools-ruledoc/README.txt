The Drools Rule Documents module aims to provide an alternative means of rule management.

Ruledocuments are human readable documents that have actual rules (nominally in a pseudo natural 
and domain specific language) embedded in them.

Ideas come from Donald Knuth's "Literate Programming" (www.literateprogramming.com).

The most fundamental valid format these days is HTML, this it will be supported as default.

Other valid and possible formats are OpenDocument (open office) and OfficeXML (Microsoft) from 
word processors.

The key idea is to keep documentation and the actual rules together.
