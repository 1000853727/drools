This is a simply little helper plug in that uses Subclipse.

It provides some actions specific to rule resources to allow committing and setting properties 
in one hit. 

basically you can commit something as draft, or as final/approved. Runtime systems can 
then choose to stay on the final versions, and ignore the draft versions until they 
are approved.
