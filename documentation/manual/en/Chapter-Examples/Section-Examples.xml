  <title>Getting the examples</title>

  <para>Some examples are included as "integration tests" in the Drools source
  code - specifically the drools-compiler module. On top of these, you can
  download the drools-examples module; which is a self contained Eclipse
  project. This module is always having more samples added to it by users. The
  example project in eclipse requires that you have the plugin instilled: load
  up the drools-examples project (it has an eclipse project already setup).
  The rules all have example classes that execute the rules. If you want to
  try the examples in another project (or another IDE) then you will need to
  setup the dependencies by hand of course.</para>

  <para>The examples can be found at
  http://anonsvn.labs.jboss.com/labs/jbossrules/trunk/drools-examples/ (you
  can browse online, or use a subversion client and download the project into
  Eclipse</para>

  <para>Future documentation will include walk throughs for each of the
  examples.</para>
