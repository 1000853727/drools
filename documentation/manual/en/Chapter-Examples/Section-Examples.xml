  <title>Getting the examples</title>

  <para>Download the drools-examples zip; which is a self contained Eclipse
  project. The example project in eclipse requires that you have the plugin
  instilled: import the drools-examples project (it has an eclipse project
  already setup). The rules all have example classes that execute the rules.
  If you want to try the examples in another project (or another IDE) then you
  will need to setup the dependencies by hand of course.</para>

  <para>Future documentation will include walk throughs for each of the
  examples.</para>
