  <title>Rule Base</title>

  <para>A rule base contains one more more packages of rules, ready to be used
  (ie they have been validated/compiled etc). Typically, a rulebase would be
  generated when the rules change, and the cached until the rules change
  again. </para>

  <para>A rulebase instance is threadsafe, in the sense that you can have the
  one instance shared accross threads in your application (which may be a web
  application, for instance). The most common operation on a rulebase is to
  create a newWorkingMemory. </para>

  <para>The rulebase also holds weak references to any working memories that
  it has spawned, so if rules are changing (or being added/removed etc) for
  long running working memories, they can be updated with the latest rules
  (without necessarily having to restart the working memory). </para>
