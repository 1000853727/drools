  <para>The event package provides means to be notified of rule engine events, including rules firing, objects being asserted etc. This
  allows you to seperate out logging/auditing activities from the main part of your application (and the rules) - as events are a cross cutting concern.</para>

  <para>
		Refer to the org.drools.event package in the drools-core module javadocs. This provides interfaces, and debug implementations of event classes that you can wire in to monitor the rule engine.
		The Eclipse based Rule IDE also provides a audit logger, and graphical viewer, so that the rule engine can log events for later viewing, and auditing.
