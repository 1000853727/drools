    <title>Shadow Facts</title>

    <para>A shadow fact is a shallow copy of an asserted object. Shadow facts
    are cached version of a given object asserted to the working memory. The
    term shadow facts is common known as a feature of JESS (Java Expert System
    Shell). The origins of shadow facts trace back to Truth maintenance
    concepts. A running system may alter a fact during evaluation. When this
    occurs, the rule engine must know a modification occurred and handle the
    change appropriately. One way to handle changes in an orderly fashion is
    to cache a shallow copy of an object. As of Drools 3.0, shadow facts
    hasn't been implemented, but it is planned for the future.</para>
