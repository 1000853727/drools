  <para>Drools provides an eclipse based IDE (which is optional), but at its
  core only Java 1.4 (J2SE) is required.</para>

  <para>A simple way to get started is to download and install the eclipse
  plug in. This will provide you with all the dependencies you need to get
  going: you can simply create a new rule project and everything will be done
  for you. Use of the eclipse plug in is not required. Rule files are just
  textual input (or spreadsheets as the case may be) and the IDE (also known
  as the Rule Workbench) is just a convenience.</para>

  <para>Alternatively, you can download the binary distribution, and include
  the relevant jars in your projects classpath. </para>

  <para>Drools is broken down into a few modules, some are required during
  rule development/compiling, and some are required at runtime. In many cases,
  people will simply want to include all the dependencies at runtime, and this
  is fine. It allows you to have the most flexibility. However, some may
  prefer to have their "runtime" stripped down to the bare minimum, as they
  will be deploying rules in binary form - this is also possible. The core
  runtime engine can be quite compact, and only require a few 100 kilobytes
  across 2 jar files. </para>
