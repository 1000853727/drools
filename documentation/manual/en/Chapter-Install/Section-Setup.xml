	<para>
		Past releases used to use maven 2 as the build mechanism, but now ant is used as the primary mechanism. Maven is used underneath the covers as the mechanism for managing project dependencies etc. (You can of course still have maven 2 installed and use it if needed - there is a pom.xml structure for each module - this is what is used for dependency management).
