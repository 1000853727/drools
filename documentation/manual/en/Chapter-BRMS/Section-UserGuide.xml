    <title>Quick start guide</title>

    <para>If you are reading this, you must be the impatient type who wants to
    kick the tyres (and light the fires) and have a look around as soon as
    possible. This section will provide a quick end to end tour of the steps
    involved (but not go through the concepts in detail). This assumes you
    have installed the repository correctly, and are able to access the main
    login screen.</para>

    <para>You can also consult the wiki:
    http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=RulesRepository for some
    tutorials and user tips.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Initial configuration</title>

      <para>Some initial setup is required the first time. The first time the
      server starts up, it will create an empty repository, then take the
      following steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Once deployed, go to "http://&lt;your
          server&gt;/drools-jbrms/" (This will show the initial info
          screen)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If it is a brand new repository, you will want to go to
          "Admin", and choose "Manage Categories"</para>

          <para>(Add a few categories of your choosing, categories are only
          for classification, not for execution or anything else.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Rules need a fact model (object model) to work off, so next
          you will want to go to the Package management feature. From here you
          can click on the icon to create a new package (give it a meaningful
          name, with no spaces).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>To upload a model, use a jar which has the fact model (API)
          that you will be using in your rules and your code (go and make one
          now if you need to !). Then click on the icon for uploading a new
          model. When you are in the model editor screen, you can upload a jar
          file, choose the package name from the list that you created in the
          previous step.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Now edit your package configuration (you just created) to
          import the fact types you just uploaded (add import statements), and
          save the changes.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>At this point, the package is configured and ready to go (you
          generally won't have to go through that step very often).</para>

          <para>(Note that you can also import an existing drl package - it
          will store the rules in the repository as individual assets).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Writing some rules</title>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Once you have at least one category and one package setup, you
          can author rules.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>There are multiple rule "formats", but from the BRMS point of
          view, they are all "assets".</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You create a rule by clicking the icon with the rules logo
          (the head), and from that you enter a name.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You will also have to choose one category. Cateogies provide a
          way of viewing rules that is seperate to packages (and you can make
          rules appear in multiple packages) - think of it like
          tagging.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Chose the "Business rule (guided editor)" formats.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>This will open a rule modeller, which is a guided editor. You
          can add and edit conditions and actions based on the model that is
          in use in the current package. Also, any DSL sentence templates
          setup for the package will be available.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>When you are done with rule editing, you can check in the
          changes (save), or you can validate or "view source" (for the
          effective source).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You can also add/remove categories from the rule editor, and
          other attributes such as documentation (if you aren't sure what to
          do, write a document in natural language describing the rule, and
          check it in, that can also serve as a template later)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Finding stuff</title>

      <para>In terms of navigating, you can either use the Rules feature,
      which shows things grouped by categories, or you can use the Package
      feature, and view by package (and rule type). If you know the name or
      part of the name of an asset, you can also use the "Quick find", start
      typing a rule name and it will return a list of matches as you type (so
      if you have a sensible naming scheme, it will make it very quick to find
      stuff).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deployment</title>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>After you have edited some rules in a package, you can click
          on the package feature, open the package that you wish, and build
          the whole package.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If that succeeds, then you will be able to download a binary
          package file which can be deployed into a runtime system.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You can also take a "snapshot" of a package for deployment.
          This freezes the package at that point in time, so any concurrent
          changes to not effect the package. It also makes the package
          available on a URL of the form: "http://&lt;your
          server&gt;/drools-jbrms/org.drools.brms.JBRMS/packages/&lt;packageName&gt;/&lt;snapshotName&gt;"
          (where you can use that URL and downloads will be covered in the
          section on deployment).</para>

      <para>[enumerate and have some screenshots of different rule assets,

      <para>Vanilla DRL - regular DRL "files" can be managed in the BRMs. A
      DRL can either be a whole chunk of rules, or an individual rule. if its
      an individual rule, no package statement or imports are required.
      Normally you would use the IDE to edit raw DRL files, since it has all
      the advanced tooling and content assistance and debugging.</para>

      <para>If you import a vanilla DRL into a new package, it will
      automatically break apart the rules in to separate assets. </para>

      <title>Navigating and finding rules</title>

      <para>The two main ways of viewing the repository are by using
      user-driven Categorisation (tagging) as outlined above, and the package
      explorer view.</para>

      <para>The category view provides a way to navigate your rules in a way
      that makes sense to your organisation.</para>

      <para>The alternative and more technical view is to use the package
      explorer. This shows the rules (assets) closer to how they are actually
      stored in the database, and also seperates rules into packages (name
      spaces) and their type (format, as rules can be in many different
      formats).</para>
