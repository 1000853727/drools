	<title>Navigating and finding rules</title>
	<para>The two main ways of viewing the repository are by using user-driven Categorisation (tagging) as outlined above. This provides a way to navigate your rules in a way that makes sense to your organisation. An alternative and more technical view is to use the package explorer. This shows the rules (assets) closer to how they are actually stored in the database, and also seperates rules into packages (name spaces) and their type of rule.</para>
