  <title>How To Use</title>

  <para>This section explains not yet in detail the use of the Java Rule
  Engine API with the implementation for JBoss Rules.</para>

  <section>
    <title>J2SE Environment</title>

    <para>This section shows you, how to use JBoss Rules over the Java Rule
    Engine API in your java applications.</para>

  <section>
    <title>J2EE Environment</title>

    <para>If you are using JBoss Rules in a container managed environment, you
    might want to use it as a service. This section presents, how to use the
    rule engine with the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) or using
    it inside of an enterprise application such as web archive (WAR), java
    archive (JAR) or enterprise archive (EAR), which is deployed into the
    server.</para>

    <title>Domain Specific Languages (DSL)</title>

    <para>It is possible to use Domain Specific Languages together with the
    Java Rule Engine API. The DSL is shipped to the Rule Engine with the Map
    of properties, when you are creating a RuleExecutionSet. Just insert the
    content of your dsl file as a String with the key "dsl" into the Map. The
    excerpt shows how it works:</para>

    <programlisting>Reader reader = new FileReader( "jsr94.dsl" );
StringBuffer text = new StringBuffer();
char[] buf = new char[1024]; int len = 0;
//Writes the file content in the StringBuffer 
while ( ( len = reader.read( buf ) ) &gt;= 0 ) 
{ 
 text.append( buf, 0, len );
}
HashMap properties = new java.util.HashMap( ); 
properties.put( "name" , "JSR94_Example" ); 
properties.put( "description", "no description" ); 
//Put the dsl as a String, use the key "dsl"
properties.put( "dsl", text.toString( ) );
reader = new FileReader( "jsr94.drl" );
RuleServiceProviderManager.registerRuleServiceProvider( "http://drools.org", Class.forName( "org.drools.jsr94.rules.RuleServiceProviderImpl" ) );
RuleServiceProvider ruleServiceProvider = RuleServiceProviderManager.getRuleServiceProvider( "http://drools.org" );
RuleExecutionSet ruleExecutionSet = ruleSetProvider.createRuleExecutionSet( reader, properties );
RuleAdministrator ruleAdministrator = ruleServiceProvider.getRuleAdministrator( );
ruleAdministrator.registerRuleExecutionSet( "JSR94_Example", ruleExecutionSet, properties );</programlisting>

    <para>Do not forget to declare the expander -in this case "jsr94.dsl"- in
    your rule file (drl).</para>

    <title>Globals</title>

    <para>You do not need to dispense with globals using Drools through the
    Java Rule Enige API. They are as usual defined in your rule file (drl).
    You need to ship them with the Map of properties to the Rule Engine
    creating a stateful or stateless RuleSession. It works like the Domain
    Specific Language for creating a RuleExecutionSet. The key you put in the
    Map will be the identifier in the drl file. In the following example the
    results are collected in an java.util.Vector which is used as
    global:</para>

    <programlisting>java.util.Vector globalVector = new java.util.Vector( );
java.util.Map map = new java.util.HashMap( );
map.put( "vector", globalVector ); 
//Open a stateless Session StatelessRuleSession srs = (StatelessRuleSession) runtime.createRuleSession( "SistersRules", map, RuleRuntime.STATELESS_SESSION_TYPE );
...
// Persons added to List
// call executeRules( ) giving a List of Objects as parameter
// There are rules which will put Objects in the Vector
// fetch the vector from the map
v = (java.util.Vector)map.get("vector");</programlisting>

    <para>Do not forget to declare the global "vector" in your DRL:</para>

    <programlisting>package SistersRules; 
import org.drools.jsr94.rules.Person; 
global java.util.Vector vector 
rule FindSisters 
when 
$person1 : Person ( $name1:name ) 
$person2 : Person ( $name2:name ) 
eval( $person1.hasSister($person2) ) 
then 
vector.add($person1.getName() + " and " + $person2.getName() +" are sisters"); 
assert( $person1.getName() + " and " + $person2.getName() +" are sisters"); 
end</programlisting>
