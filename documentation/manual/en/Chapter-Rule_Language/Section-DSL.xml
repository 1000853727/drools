  <title>Domain Specific Languages</title>

  <para>As mentioned previously, Domain Specific Languages (or DSLs) are a way of extending the rule language to your problem domain.
  They are wired in to the rule language for you, and can make use of all the underlying rule langauge and engine features.</para>

    <title>When to use a DSL</title>
	<para>DSLs can serve as a layer of seperation between rule authoring (and rule authors) and the domain objects that the engine operates on.
	DSLs can also act as "templates" of conditions or actions that are used over and over in your rules, perhaps only with parameters changing each time.
	If your rules need to be read and validated by less technical folk, (such as Business Analysts) the DSLs are definately for you.
