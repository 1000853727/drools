  <title>Package</title>

  <para>A package is basically a collection of rules (rules that are logically
  related to each other - perhaps HR rules, for instance). A package
  represents a namespace, which ideally is kept unique for a given grouping of
  rules. The package name itself is the namespace, and is not related to files
  or folders in any way. </para>

  <para>At the Package level items are things like functions, imports, global
  data and so on.</para>

  <para>Not that it is possible to assemble rules from multiple rule sources,
  and have one top level package configuration that all the rules are kept
  under (when the rules are assembled). A common structure, however, is to
  have all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration
  (so that is it entirely self contained).</para>

  <para>The following rail road diagram shows all the components that may make
  up a package. Not that a package MUST have a namespace (which can contain no
  spaces). In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in
  the rule file, with the exception of the "package" and "expander" statements
  being at the top of the file, before any rules appear. In all cases, the
  semi colons are optional.</para>

    <para>Import statements work like import statements in Java. You need to
    specify the fully qualified paths and type names for any objects you want
    to use in the rule.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>The expander statement (optional) is used to specify domain specific
    language configurations (which are normally stored in a seperate file).
    This provides clues to the parser as to how to understand what you are
    raving on about in your rules.</para>

    <para>Globals are global variables (although ideally, they won't change in
    value while the rules are executing). They typically are used to return
    data, such as a log of actions, or provide data or services that the rules
    use.</para>

    <para>Note that these are just named instances of objects that you pass in
    from your application to the working memory. This means you can pass in
    any object you want: you could pass in a service locator, or perhaps a
    service itself. </para>

    <para>One example may be an instance of a Email service. In your
    integration code that is calling the rule engine, you get your
    emailService object, and then set it in the working memory. In the DRL,
    you declare that you have a global of type EmailService, and give it a
    name "email". Then in your rule consequences, you can use things like
    email.sendSMS(number, message); etc... (you get the idea). </para>

    <para>It is important to NOT use globals as a replacement for asserting
    facts, if you do, you are bypassing most of the rule engines power, and
    may get suprising results (surprising in a bad way, like when a doctor
    says "thats interesting" to a chest XRay of yours).</para>
