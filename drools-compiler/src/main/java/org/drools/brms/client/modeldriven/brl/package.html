	This package holds classes that are used as RPC classes for the rule modeller, 
	as well as the DOM for the BRL rule format that the rule modeller uses.
	
	IMPORTANT:
	Do not change these unless you are adding fields or removing fields, not refactoring
	fields. Especially if there is existing data. XSLT may need to be used to massage
	the existing XML to suit the new structure.
