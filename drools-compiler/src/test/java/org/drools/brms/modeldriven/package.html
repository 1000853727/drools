This contains utilities and widgets for the model driven/scorecard style way of
editing a rule.

This has the interesting feature of being able to work over standard DRL, no special markup needed.
Its actually a subset of DRL, complex structures and semantics can not be supported.

However, this can be augmented with DSLs which can express any construct needed.
