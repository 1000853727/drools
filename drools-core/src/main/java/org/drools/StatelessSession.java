 * provided all the data in one hit, and a conclusion reached by the engine.
 * (there is no accumulation of facts/knowledge - each invocation is on a fresh session).
 * 
 * Each created StatelessSession can be call execute() any number of times, in a stateless manner
 * however the GlobalResolver, unless set each time, is shared between each execute() method call.
 * 
 * Care should be used when using the async versions of the methods, consult the javadoc for
